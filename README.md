## 👁️‍🗨️ Who am I?

A digital wanderer, a soon-to-be engineer, and a lifelong learner with an insatiable curiosity for the unseen gears behind how everything works, sometimes even how things _should_ work. I turn shawarma and logic into elegant solutions, whether in code, in the cloud, or in the wild world of connected things.

- **Industry Chameleon**: From corporate clouds to startup sprints, from data dungeons to IoT jungles—my passport is stamped with tech from every corner of the digital globe.
- **Wisdom With a Wink**: My solutions are robust, my humor is dry, and my Git history is clean (most days).
- **Explorer at Heart**: I code as I travel—open to every border, eager for every challenge, ready for the next adventure. Ask me about my favorite racetrack or the quirkiest bug I’ve ever fixed.
